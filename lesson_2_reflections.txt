What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When I initialize a repository git create a hidden directory where it's storing
a metadata needed to track history of files. Why do I need it? I have no idea.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?
I can add files to the staging area and before every commit I can check what changes
I've made and remove files from staging area when needed.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?
Branches would be helpful in keeping my history organized when I want to check
a new experimental feature which can won't work.
